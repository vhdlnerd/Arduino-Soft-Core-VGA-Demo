This project is a demo of the vnVGA firmware design and it is a fork of the Arduino Soft Core project.

This project is coded in VHDL and targets a Papilio Plus board (with a VGA wing).

The following is the readme file of the original project:
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Arduino Soft Core is the combination of the AVR8 Soft Processor and the Arduino IDE modified to run on the Open Source Papilio FPGA development board.

For more information visit http://papilio.cc

The AVR8 Soft processor was originally downloaded from [OpenCores.com](http://opencores.com/project,avr_core).

The Arduino IDE is modified to merge sketches into the AVR8 processor and load the processor and sketch the the Papilio One FPGA dev board.
